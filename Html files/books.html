              <h2>Murder mystery puzzle book Murdle tops UK Christmas bestseller chart
                GT Karber’s book of challenges beats Richard Osman’s The Last Devil to Die and Guinness World Records to top spot

              <p>
                The murder mystery puzzle book Murdle by US writer GT Karber has climbed the UK bestsellers chart to become this year’s Christmas No 1 book, beating Richard Osman’s The Last Devil to Die and Guinness World Records for the top spot.

                Murdle is based on the daily puzzle website Karber developed in 2021, and across the book’s 100 challenges, readers must use codes and maps to decipher who the killers are. It has sold more than 200,000 copies since its publication in June, according to Nielsen BookScan’s chart. Almost a third of those sales have been in the last month, after it was named Waterstones’ gift of the year at the end of November.
                
                Arkansas-born, LA-based Karber said his “greatest hope is that this little book brings people together over the holidays, and lets them share some joy with each other”.
                
                The Guinness World Records 2024 is this year’s No 2, down from last year, when the 2023 edition took the Christmas No 1 spot. Guinness World Records books have had a total of four Christmas No 1s, a record shared with Jamie Oliver. The chef’s 2023 offering, 5 Ingredients Mediterranean, is at No 13 in this week’s chart.
                
                The Last Devil to Die is at No 3 overall, yet marks the seventh time Osman has been the Christmas No 1 in the original fiction category. Britain’s fastest-selling graphic novel of all time, Heartstopper Volume 5 by Alice Oseman came in at No 4 in the overall chart, and No 1 in Children’s. Meanwhile, Booker prize winner Prophet Song by Paul Lynch took the Christmas No 1 in the Irish bestseller charts, selling more than 8,000 copies.
                
                Across the year as a whole, Prince Harry’s revelatory memoir Spare was the UK’s bestselling book of 2023, having sold more than 700,000 copies since its publication in January. The paperback edition of Bonnie Garmus’s novel Lessons in Chemistry was the year’s second overall bestseller. The 60s-set debut novel about a chemist-turned-TV chef has been a stalwart of the bestseller charts since it came out in April 2022, and an Apple TV screen adaptation starring Brie Larson began streaming in October.
                
                Osman came in at both No 3 and No 4 in the overall Sunday Times bestsellers of 2023, with The Last Devil to Die and The Bullet That Missed respectively. The top cookbook, and fifth overall, was Bored of Lunch: The Healthy Air Fryer Book by Nathan Anthony.</p>

              <h2>Clown in a Cornfield 3: The Church of Frendo’ – Cover Art Revealed for Next Year’s Sequel Novel! [Exclusive]</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cornfield-clown.png?w=1550&ssl=1" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
             <p>
              Bram Stoker Award-Winning author Adam Cesare released his original slasher novel Clown in a Cornfield in 2020, which Bloody Disgusting’s own Meagan Navarro called “a great retro slasher in the guise of Young Adult horror.” Meagan added, “Cesare applies an ’80s style slasher to a modern setting, complete with social relevancy, making the small town setting just as eerie as its homicidal, creepy clown. In other words, this author doesn’t water the horror down for its Young Adult demographic, making it an enjoyable read for any horror fan.”

              Sequel novel Clown in a Cornfield 2: Frendo Lives followed one year later, and Cesare is back NEXT YEAR with third installment Clown in a Cornfield 3: The Church of Frendo!
              
              HarperCollins will release Clown in a Cornfield 3: The Church of Frendo on August 20, 2024, and Bloody Disgusting is exclusively debuting the book’s cover art this afternoon.
              
              The art comes from illustrator Matt Ryan Tobin and designer Jenna Stempel-Lobell. Check out the cover for Clown in a Cornfield 3: The Church of Frendo down below!
              
              Cesare tells Bloody Disgusting, “There’s some weirdness with a capital W. And some 70s revenge/road movie vibes.” Here’s the official plot synopsis from HarperTeen…
              
              “After surviving the Frendo rampage at Tillerson’s Farm, the Frendo attack in her college dorm, and the clown uprising in downtown Kettle Springs, Quinn Maybrook is determined to put an end to the cult of Frendo once and for all. But what Quinn doesn’t realize is that an evil like this never dies … it multiplies.”

                On Aug. 12, 2022, Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie survived a stabbing in which he lost sight in one eye and the use of one of his hands (the latter is coming back). While he's best known for his magical realism, Rushdie draws on his own experience recovering from the traumatic attack in his latest book. In an interview with TIME earlier this year, the novelist described writing the book as part of his healing process—“a way of kind of taking charge of it”—and not letting the incident control him.</p>

                Amor Towles’ latest is an immersive collection of short works of fiction set in turn-of-the-millennium New York and Golden Age Hollywood. The book features six short stories and a novella that centers on Evelyn Ross, a character from Towles’ debut novel The Rules of Civility. The author, whose previous three novels have collectively sold more than six million copies worldwide, told Today that the majority of the narratives in Table for Two deal with fateful encounters between strangers or family members. “When I finished the collection,” he said, “it occurred to me that in many of the stories, a critical moment in the tale involved two of the characters facing each other across a kitchen table to confront some new reality in their lives.”</p></a>

            <h2>Oh Mother, What Have You Done?’ – New Book from Tom Holland Looks at the Making of ‘Psycho II’</h2>
            <a href="#"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/psycho-22.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
            <p>One of the best horror sequels ever made, 1983’s Psycho II has received its own making-of book titled Oh Mother, What Have You Done?, BD has learned this week.

              Oh Mother, What Have You Done? is AVAILABLE NOW in both hardback and paperback through Amazon and at Terror Time (for copies autographed by Tom Holland)!
              
              In the 176-page book from Holland House Ent., Psycho II screenwriter Tom Holland plunges into the fascinating story of the making of his critically acclaimed horror sequel.
              
              Authored by Tom Holland and containing unpublished memoirs by late Psycho II director Richard Franklin and conversations with the film’s editor Andrew London, Oh Mother, What Have You Done? offers fans a unique glimpse into the continuation of the beloved Psycho film franchise, which created nightmares for millions of people showering worldwide.
              
              Created using never-before-seen production materials and photos – many from Holland’s own personal archive – Oh Mother, What Have You Done? abounds with rare hand-written development and production notes, early budgets, personal Polaroids and more, all set against fascinating conversations with the film’s writer, director and editor which document the development, filming, and reception of the much-celebrated Psycho II.
              
              Holland said in a statement, “I wrote Psycho II, the first sequel that began the Psycho legacy, forty years ago this past summer, and the film was a huge success in the year 1983, but who remembers? To my surprise, apparently, they do, because on the film’s fortieth anniversary love from fans began to pour in, much to my amazement and pleasure. And then (Psycho II director) Richard Franklin’s unpublished memoirs arrived unexpectedly. I’d had no idea he’d written them before he passed in 2007.”
              
              “Reading them was like being transported back in time, and I had to share them, along with my memories and personal archives with the fans of Psycho, the sequels, and the excellent Bates Motel. I hope they enjoy reading the book as much as I did in putting it together,” Holland continues. “My thanks to Andrew London, who edited, and to Mr. Hitchcock, without whom none of this would have existed.”</p>
