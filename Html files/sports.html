              <h2>US Soccer Federation refuses MLS attempt to pull top rosters from US Open Cup</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7B8o5RLOCs9.vK2gtktQYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/abe31d039f300cc39ba2b9742cbec421" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
              <p>
                CHICAGO (AP) — The U.S. Soccer Federation refused Major League Soccer's attempt to pull its top rosters from next year's U.S. Open Cup, the sport's oldest competition in the nation.

While MLS announced in a statement at 6 p.m. EST Friday that its board of governors decided to send teams to the tournament from its third tier MLS Next Pro rosters, the USSF characterized the league's action only as a request that had been turned down.

“As we move forward, we will continue our review of the Open Cup to ensure it aligns with the U.S. Soccer strategic pillars,” the USSF said in a statement Wednesday. “We remain committed to addressing the needs and concerns of all of our members, including MLS, and other stakeholders to enhance and improve the U.S. Open Cup.”

MLS issued a statement four minutes later saying it “is committed to finding a viable solution for the 2024 tournament and is working to find a pathway that addresses its goals and concerns.”

“Moving forward, MLS will remain focused on increasing opportunities for up-and-coming players, a key component of the league’s player development strategy that ultimately benefits the U.S. national team program.”

MLS added “it believes that there are several essential goals and concerns that must be addressed in connection with the tournament, including developing young professional players and providing them with greater opportunity to play before fans in meaningful competition in a tournament setting, prioritizing player health and safety, reducing schedule congestion for MLS clubs, and enhanced investment from U.S. Soccer.”

The United Soccer League, which entered 46 of the 99 teams in this year's tournament, said in a statement: “We stand with fans across the country who want to see it remain an authentic and inclusive competition.”

Houston beat Inter Miami this year in the U.S. Open Cup final, earning a berth next year in the CONCACAF Champions Cup. Miami star Lionel Messi was injured and missed the match.

The U.S. Open Cup began in the 1913-14 season, and MLS started play in 1996. Since the start of MLS, the only team not from the first tier to win the competition was the 1999 Rochester Raging Rhinos of the USL's second-tier A-League, which beat the Colorado Rapids 2-0 in the final.</p>

                Rodri urged Manchester City to finish the job and make history when they face Fluminense in the Club World Cup final on Friday, admitting his side had needed to shake off a “very bad feeling in the changing room” caused by a slump in their domestic form.
                
                City swatted aside Urawa Red Diamonds with a commanding semi-final performance in Jeddah, easing three goals clear of their opponents within an hour. It was an impressive display of application little more than 72 hours after they had been pegged back to a 2-2 draw by Crystal Palace, leaving them fourth in the top flight. Now they have a chance to rule the world and win their fifth honour in 2023.

                For 92 minutes Chelsea were at their blunt, wasteful worst. Nicolas Jackson spurned chances and Raheem Sterling missed passes. Axel Disasi advanced from right-back, thought about overlapping and then checked back. Armando Broja spent the evening straying offside and Newcastle led when Benoît Badiashile got confused while trying to dribble away from Callum Wilson.
                
                It seemed that Wilson’s early goal would be enough for Newcastle to move on from the disappointment of going out of the Champions League. Instead Eddie Howe was left to stomach more players falling injured and his side enduring a second cup exit in the space of the week. All because Kieran Trippier, normally such a reliable defender, has had a complete systems failure and appears to be in need of a good lie down over the festive period.</p>

                <h2>Captain Sergi Roberto scored twice as Barcelona held off bottom club Almeria to claim three valuable points in the La Liga title race.</h2>
                <a href="#"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/976/cpsprodpb/12606/production/_132107257_gettyimages-1870493752.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
               <a href="#"><p>
                The result lifts Barca to third in the table, six points behind leaders Girona and four adrift of second-placed Real Madrid, who both have a game in hand.

Goals from Raphinha and Roberto twice put the hosts ahead, only for Leo Baptistao and Edgar Gonzalez to level.

However, Roberto's late effort ended their three-game winless run.

Xavi's side now travel to Dallas for a friendly against Mexican side Club America before they head into their winter break, with their next fixture at Las Palmas on 4 January.

In truth they perhaps could and should have won by more against a plucky Almeria side who rode their luck and benefited greatly from some indecision and poor play in the Barcelona defence.

Leo Baptistao was played onside by Ronald Araujo to equalise after Raphinha had smashed in from close range to give the hosts a first-half lead.

And Roberto's header on the hour mark was cancelled out after a mistake from stand-in goalkeeper Inaki Pena allowed Gonzalez to tap in.

Barca forward Robert Lewandowski, who has now scored three goals in 14 matches in all competitions, also had several good opportunities to score.</p></a>

                <h2>Dani Alves: Trial set for February 2024 for ex-Brazil and Barcelona defender</h2>
                <a href="#"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/976/cpsprodpb/15D29/production/_128358398_gettyimages-1245390699.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
               <a href="#"><p>
                Former Brazil and Barcelona defender Dani Alves' trial in Spain for alleged sexual assault has been set for 5-7 February 2024.

Alves, 40, has been in prison without bail since he was arrested in January over an allegation he assaulted a woman in a Barcelona nightclub last year.

He said he had consensual sex with his accuser after initially denying any sexual encounter with her.

A Spanish prosecutor is seeking a prison term of nine years for Alves.

The prosecutor has also asked for him to receive a restraining order following the jail term and for him to pay damages worth 150,000 euros (£130,000) to the woman.

A court in the Barcelona area formally indicted Alves in August and later decided there was enough evidence to send him to trial.

Alves, capped 126 times for Brazil, played for his country at the Qatar World Cup in 2022. He had his contract with Mexican club UNAM terminated after his arrest.

In Spain, a claim of rape is investigated under the general accusation of sexual assault and convictions can lead to prison sentences of between four and 15 years.</p></a>

               <a href="#"><p>
                With the shot clock running out, Curry hit a three-pointer as the Warriors won 132-126 at San Francisco's Chase Center.

The Warriors trailed from halftime until the second minute of overtime as they registered a third successive win.

Eastern Conference leaders Boston saw a five-game wining run end.

Steve Kerr's Warriors, who sit 11th in the Western Conference, are building momentum at just the right time as they close in on the play-off places.

Elsewhere, the struggling Memphis Grizzlies benefited from Ja Morant's return from a 25-game suspension following social media posts in which he displayed a gun.

Morant scored 34 points with eight assists and six rebounds as he drove for a game-winning layup with time expiring to lead the Grizzlies to a 115-113 win against the New Orleans Pelicans.

"I ain't played a game in eight months," he told broadcaster TNT. "Had a lot of time... a lot of hard days where I went through it.

"But you know, basketball is my life, what I love, therapeutic for me and I'm just excited to be back."

Damian Lillard scored a season-high 40 points as Milwaukee Bucks beat San Antonio Spurs 132-119.

Lillard became the 51st NBA player to reach 20,000 career points to help the Bucks extend their winning streak to five.

"The 20,000 points, when I hear that it takes me back to the beginning," Lillard said. "It's a blessing and an honour to have that type of accomplishment."

The Phoenix Suns' hopes of sealing a playoff berth took a hit as they slumped to a third defeat from their last four fixtures when going down 109-104 against the Portland Trail Blazers.

Anfernee Simons registered 23 points and seven assists as Portland snapped a seven-game losing streak.</p></a>

               <a href="#"><p>
                Callum Wilson's 16th-minute goal looked to be sending Newcastle into the last four until substitute Mykhailo Mudryk pounced on the veteran defender's error deep into stoppage time to send the game to spot-kicks.

The 33-year-old, who has suffered a dip in form recently, then fired Newcastle's second penalty wide and once keeper Djordje Petrovic saved Matt Ritchie's spot-kick Chelsea had gone from the despair of contemplating defeat to the sheer elation of a place in the last four.

It was cruel on Trippier, such an influential figure under manager Eddie Howe, but his fatal indecision on a header gave Chelsea that lifeline which Mudryk gratefully accepted.

Cole Palmer, Conor Gallagher, Christopher Nkunku and Mudryk were all on target for Chelsea but only Callum Wilson and Bruno Guimaraes scored penalties for Newcastle, who suffered fresh disappointment after their Champions League exit.

The draw for the semi-finals takes place after Liverpool v West Ham on Wednesday, with the first leg of those ties being played in the week commencing 8 January.

Police investigating incident between fan and Dubravka
Following Mudryk's equaliser a male Chelsea fan climbed over the advertising hoardings before celebrating in the face of and bumping into Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka.

The fan was then led back into the crowd with referee Jarred Gillet speaking to stadium security before the shootout began.</p></a>

               <a href="#"><p>
                Phil Salt's second successive century helped England hit their highest T20 international total in a chaotic 75-run win over West Indies to level the series.

                Salt's astonishing 119 - the highest score by an England men's batter in the format - came from just 57 balls and included 10 sixes as the tourists finished with 267-3.
                
                Captain Jos Buttler smashed 55 from 29 balls and Liam Livingstone added an unbeaten 54 from 21 at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Trinidad.
                
                West Indies kept up with the imposing run-rate during their entertaining chasing effort, but regular wickets cost them, the hosts falling to 192 all out.
                
                The hosts amassed 87 from the first six overs, but England held their nerve and fought back to break every dangerous partnership, with each bowler taking at least one wicket.
                
                All-rounder Andre Russell gave the hosts late hope with a dynamic 24-ball half-century before he was the last batter to be dismissed in the 16th over by Reece Topley, who claimed 3-37.
                
                England have come from 2-0 down to level the series at 2-2, with the decider taking place at the same venue on Thursday.</p></a>

"We have decided to continue contacts with Uefa, especially as there is progress," said RFU committee member Mikhail Gershkovich.

"Let's see how the situation develops next year."

                Gerri Colombe and Allaho remained among the entries as eight horses were confirmed for the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day.

                Gerri Colombe will bid to give trainer Gordon Elliott a first win in the race if the ground at Kempton does not dry out too much.

                In June 2016, hundreds of fans gathered at Shanghai airport to watch one of the most famous footballers in the world make the city his home.

                Hulk, a 29-year-old Brazil international at the peak of his powers, had been signed by Shanghai SIPG manager Sven-Goran Eriksson for more than £46m and would earn reported wages of £320,000 a week.
                
                As he strode through arrivals, a welcoming bouquet of flowers was thrust into his arms and a Shanghai SIPG scarf draped over his neck.
                
                Over the next three years, he was joined by other big names, signed for even bigger price tags.
                
                Chelsea star Oscar arrived six months later. The transfer fee was about £60m, while his wages were believed to be £400,000 a week.
                
                Carlos Tevez, who had won the Premier League with Manchester United and City, reportedly earned even more when he joined.
                
                Paris St-Germain star Ezequiel Lavezzi,Liverpool target Alex Teixeira and Colombia striker Jackson Martinez were also lured with astronomical transfer fees and bumper pay cheques.
                
                The rise of the Super League came alongside President Xi Jinping's wish to turn the country into a footballing nation. In 2011, he announced plans for the men's national team to qualify for a World Cup and for China to eventually host the tournament.</p></a>

            <h2>January transfer window: the MLS stars European clubs should target</h2>
            <a href="#"><img src="images/3201.webp" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
            <p>In the last January transfer window, 33 players left Major League Soccer for Europe. Top European clubs are increasingly looking to US soccer in search of stars who, thanks to the American season finishing in December, are primed to hit the ground running upon arrival.

                And after a season that drew more transatlantic attention than ever before thanks to Lionel Messi’s move to Inter Miami, several MLS stars will have caught the eye of Europe’s elite.
                
                Thiago Almada, midfielder, Atlanta United
                It was something of a surprise when Almada landed in MLS in December 2021, rather than electing for a move to a European giant. The Argentinian attacking midfielder became the most expensive signing in the history of the US top division when he joined Atlanta United from Vélez Sarsfield in a deal worth $16m.</p>
