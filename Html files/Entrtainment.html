              <h2>The Best Games Of 2023</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4214055-bestof2023.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
              <p>
                2023 is set to go down as an all-time great when it comes to the most memorable years in gaming. It's not often that you get so many months of high-profile and critically acclaimed releases, but this year has delivered a seemingly endless line of AAA blockbusters and smaller games with impressive ideas at their cores. We're taking a look at the games that got a review score of 8 (which we deem "great") or higher on GameSpot over the course of the year.

                That's not to say that the games that scored below that threshold (or that we didn't review) aren't worth playing. But we've nonetheless got a hefty list to go through--games of an incredibly high standard that are spread out across a wide variety of genres and themes.
                
                This list has five games that got an ultra-rare 10/10 score from GameSpot. At the same time, dozens of other 2023 releases excelled in their efforts to provide unmissable entertainment on various platforms. The list below is encouragingly diverse as well, as between the usual high-budget blockbusters and sequels, there are titles with more intimate stories to tell, lower stakes, and innovative approaches to their respective genres.
                
                For more, the GameSpot Reviewcast will give you a behind-the-scenes tour of how our reviewers came to their conclusions.</p>

              <h2>Returnal PC -- 9</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4213458-returnal.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
             <p>
              Returnal is developer Housemarque at its arcade-inspired best, an unrelenting score attack of intense action, bullet hell, and endless resets until you nail that one perfect run. On PC, the game is even better, a technical masterpiece that takes full advantage of that platform to deliver a gorgeous graphical upgrade to an already terrific game. Compared to some of the less-than-stellar PC ports that needed months of post-launch fine-tuning, Returnal sets the bar for how well a PlayStation Studios game should play on PC from day one.

              <h2>The Expanse -- 9</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4213486-expanse.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>

                Few studios can deliver decision-heavy games that'll have you sweating as Telltale Games can, and with the studio back in action after several turbulent years, The Expanse is a stellar example of a lean-and-mean sci-fi game that feels incredibly focused. All of Telltale's signature gameplay elements are here, from excellent voice-acting to a gripping narrative that feels like an organic extension of the beloved sci-fi series, all of which creates a stellar adventure that'll keep you awake at night as you ponder the tough choices that you made in it.</p>

                Developer Geometric Interactive has made a big splash with its debut game, Cocoon, as this intricate blend of puzzles and riddles pulls at your gray matter with captivating content. Not just a fun collection of brain teasers, Cocoon combines fantastic sound design and art with some of the tightest level design around to deliver a subtle but brilliantly told story.</p></a>

                Unlike many other premium controllers, the Stealth Ultra doesn't have swappable parts. Physical customization features are limited to trigger locks and two pairs of rubber caps that wrap around the default sticks. There's a pair of concave caps and textured dome caps. The main benefit of these is they effectively make the sticks larger, so they could be useful for those with larger hands (the default analog stick toppers are the same size as the first-party Xbox controller). But you won't find support for swappable D-pads or modules here. Considering all of the controls are exemplary already, the lack of swappable parts doesn't feel like a meaningful loss--especially when there's so much to love with the internal customization.

                I saved this part for last because if the core experience with a $200 controller is anything short of amazing, it doesn't really matter that it has a built-in display that can be used to tinker with all sorts of settings. But the Stealth Ultra, as a pure controller, is indeed very good, so its novel feature only enhances an already great device.
                
                You can think of the small display as built-in customization software. Whereas the Elite Series 2, 8BitDo Ultimate, Razer Wolverine V2, and other pro-style controllers require a proprietary app to make in-depth adjustments, the Stealth Ultra lets you customize your experience on the fly. With the press of the "+" button, you can switch from controlling the action on your TV to tinkering with settings on the small color screen, dubbed the Connected Command Display.
                Turtle Beach gave players a lot to work with here. For starters, you can cycle through 10 different profiles--a lot more than the usual three for these sorts of controllers. Within each profile, you can remap the four back buttons on the fly, create dead zones for sticks and triggers, adjust vibration intensity on left and/or right sides, and modify lighting color and effects. You can remap the back buttons to most inputs, with one notable omission being RS and LS clicks. Since many games use a stick press to initiate a run, it's always nice to map a back button to that action instead.

The Stealth Ultra has RGB light strips on the handles. My hands blocked a portion of the light strip while playing, but the lights were visible next to the face buttons and left stick. Along with a wide assortment of hues, the light strips can pulsate, cycle through multiple colors, breathe, etc. Plus, you can adjust the intensity of the effects. Gradient color settings didn't appear to work sometimes on my controller, but overall the lighting features are pretty cool. Don't worry, though--you can turn the lights off altogether, if you so choose.

Many of the cool features found in Turtle Beach's other Xbox controllers are present here, too. The optional Pro-Aim Focus Mode can be activated by mapping it to one of the back buttons. When on, Pro-Aim temporarily alters thumbstick sensitivity, which you can use for things like long-range shots. With a wired headset connected to the 3.5mm audio jack, you can enhance and mix your audio with onboard presets and sliders. What's cool here is that Turtle Beach's presets, though built into the manufacturer's headsets, work with any wired headset. The marquee one, Signature Sound, actually does produce crisper, cleaner audio--however, if you have a DAC, you'll still want to use that instead. Other presets alter bass and treble, and the last of the four enhances voices (chat and in-game audio). You can also mix your audio and mic settings with sliders.

The Connected Command Display can also display your notifications if you sync your phone to your Stealth Ultra. It's a quirky feature that I guess stops you from looking at your phone while playing (though you're still looking away from the screen and can't respond on the controller). Personally, receiving texts or social media notifications while gaming sounds hellish to me, but this will probably be of interest to some. Plus, it has some gaming utility if you use Discord while playing online.

                <h2>In an end-of-year Starfield update, Bethesda talks new gameplay and ship options, a "major update in February," and the RPG's first story expansion</h2>

               <a href="#"><p>
                In what looks like its last Starfield post for the year, Bethesda's committed to big changes for the RPG in 2024, revisiting promised quality-of-life features and doubling down on new gameplay options ahead of the RPG's first confirmed expansion, Shattered Space. 

                "As the year draws to a close, we want to say thank you from the whole team for all the time you've spent in Starfield and all the passion you have for the game," a post from the official Bethesda Reddit account reads. "In 2024, we'll be updating roughly every six weeks starting with our next major update in February. Here's some of what we have planned on top of regular bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements: 
                
                City maps
                New ways to travel
                New ways to customize your ships
                New gameplay options to further adjust difficulty
                Official mod support with the launch of Creations
                Our first story expansion, Shattered Space
                "More info on all of the above will be coming soon but for now, we hope you all have a relaxing holiday season and we can't wait to continue this journey with you in the new year," the post concludes.</p></a>

            <h2>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty -- 10</h2>

            <p>Phantom Liberty brings a sense of finality to Cyberpunk 2077, a game that has had a long redemption arc play out in the years since it was first released in a less-than-optimal state. With this expansion, Cyberpunk 2077 goes out with a bang as developer CD Projekt Red begins to push forward on its sequel, and the result is a captivating story within a tightly constructed spy-thriller adventure. Phantom Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077 at its very best, a complete overhaul of the original game that leaves a lasting impression by the time that the credits roll on its thrilling tale of espionage and violence.</p>
