          <p>The initiative's flagship football showdown featured QAD and Palestinian school students, playing alongside local and
            international players, media personalities, and social media influencers including Rodrigo Tabata, Yaqub Bushahri,
            Mohammed Saadoun Al-Kuwari, Ali Al-Habsi, and Yassin Ibrahimi who were divided into two teams - Qatar and
            Palestine.
            
            Over 100 students from Qatar Academy Doha volunteered at the event under the supervision of school teachers, and

          <h2>Birmingham city centre streets saw protesters gather to protest against the Israel Gaza war</h2>
          <a href="#"><img src="images/AA1lCBYu.jpeg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
         <p>Hundreds of people gathered in Birmingham city centre on Saturday (December 16) to call for an end to the conflict in Gaza.

          The demonstration follows similar previous protests held over the last month in the city centre. Those at the rally called for an end to the war and chanted ‘ceasefire now’. Pro-Palestine marches also took place in Cotteridge and Alum Rock on Saturday ahead of the march in the city centre, which got underway at 1pm.
          
          Chants of 'free Palestine' and 'ceasefire now' were sung during the protest. Protests are continuing after the seven-day Israel-Hamas ceasefire ended at the start of December "

          <h2>Who is Abu Ubaida? Hamas' masked spokesperson resurfaces with chilling warning for Israel</h2>
          <a href="#"><img src="images/AA1ljlJd.jpeg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
          <p>Abu Ubaida, Hamas' masked spokesperson, reportedly injured in an attack by the IDF, returned to Palestinian and Israeli televisions with a chilling warning for Israel and the United States. On Sunday, Hamas' armed wing said Israel will not be able to recover any of its hostages unless it engages in talks over conditional swap deals. 

            Abu Ubaida, the voice for the Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Hamas movement, said that Israel would not be able to recover the hostages by force, mentioning their failed operation to free one of them. Udaida also mentioned that Hamas fighters had partially or fully destroyed 180 Israeli personnel carriers, tanks, and bulldozers in 10 days since the war resumed in Gaza.
            
              Continue reading
            Abu Ubaida has been appearing on screens since October 7, after Mohammad Al-Deif, the commander of Al-Qassam, announced the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, one of the largest military confrontations in history between Israel and Palestinian movements.</p>

          <h2>UK interest rates expected to fall sharply next year as inflation drops to 3.9%</h2>
          <a href="#"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0c214b826ae81868ba51c341f8a11850183574/13_54_2983_1790/master/2983.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
          <p>The City is expecting interest rates to fall sharply next year following news of a much bigger than expected fall in the UK’s annual inflation rate to 3.9% in November.

            Despite the Bank of England’s insistence it is too early to contemplate reducing the cost of borrowing, the markets believe Threadneedle Street will deliver at least four interest rate cuts during 2024.
            
            Share prices in London rallied strongly after cheaper fuel and less expensive food helped bring inflation from 4.6% in October to its lowest since September 2021. The FTSE 100 Index rose by around 1% to its highest level since May.
            
            With the economy weakening in response to 14 successive interest rate rises between December 2021 and August 2023, analysts predicted the Bank would start easing its policy stance next spring.
            
            Ed Monk, an associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Another significant drop in inflation in November only adds to the case that interest rates will fall sooner than expected. The Bank of England has been talking tough, but price rises appear on a rapid decline back towards the Bank’s target range and it may soon be that the risk for rate-setters is not under-tightening but over-tightening.”
            
            Swap rates in the City’s money markets were signalling five quarter-point cuts, which would take them from 5.25% to 4% by the end of next year, bringing welcome relief to households and businesses that have seen their borrowing costs soar.
            
            Kallum Pickering, of Berenberg Bank, said: “Although Bank of England policymakers are at pains to push back against growing rate cut bets for 2024 while inflation is still well above target, the direction of travel for prices now seems clear. Although all key inflation measures remain above the 2% year on year rate which the Bank aims for, the trend of the past few months suggests that inflationary pressures are fading about as quickly as they had emerged.”.</p>

          <h2>Don’t blame the trees! Saving forests is still the best way to save the plane</h2>
          <a href="#"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33c5ffd679f074a1663a4147ff2367ebfe146c5c/0_307_4605_2763/master/4605.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
          <p>Some have recently questioned whether forests really are the climate solution they have long been held to be. This is because some emit great quantities of carbon, while the markets set up to finance them have stumbled. But there is no pathway to a livable climate without saving our intact forests, regrowing some, and finding a more straightforward way to pay for them than carbon offset projects.

            A 2021 study led by Brazilian scientists established that the Amazon was emitting more carbon dioxide than it was absorbing. The great carbon sink had seemingly become a smokestack. The paper mirrored a 2019 analysis of Canadian forests, which showed they had been net emitters since 2001.
            
            This year, as blazing forests choked the skies across eastern North America, a New York Times columnist went so far as to muse that the trees might be doing it on purpose, “fighting for the other side”.
            
            Forests absorb and emit carbon every day. During photosynthesis, they soak it up from the air and use it to make leaves, branches, fruit and other plant parts. The solid carbon is released back into the atmosphere when it burns or decomposes. Carbon is always coming and going; the important number to watch is the net change.
            
            Forests damaged by logging, roads or by the climate crisis itself have become more prone to fire and may grow slower than in the past. They’re absorbing CO2, just not quite as much as they’re releasing. Globally, however, forests continue adding vastly more carbon than they are losing. To the degree that forests may take sides, they are still on ours.
            
            The other challenge to forests’ reputation is the carbon-offset markets set up to finance tree protection and planting. Most transactions are between companies that voluntarily offset their greenhouse gas emissions by paying to save or regrow forests. Recent reports have shown they commonly fail to produce promised climate benefits and can sow divisions in communities.</p>

        <h2>World surfing body joins local opposition to controversial new Olympics tower in Tahiti</h2>

        <p>Surfing’s world governing body has said it opposes construction of a controversial new judges’ tower for the 2024 Olympics event in Tahiti which has sparked a backlash from locals and environmentalists over fears it could irreparably damage the local coral reef.

          “The International Surfing Association (ISA) will not support the construction of the new aluminum judges’ tower at Teahupo’o,” the body said in a statement, a week after construction began.</p>
