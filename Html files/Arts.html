              <h2>Long-Running Legal Drama Over Franz West’s Estate Ends With All Works Donated to His Foundation</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1213239864.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
              <p>
                A years-long legal battle in Austria over the estate of the famed sculptor Franz West concluded last month, with all of the artworks in it donated to the Franz West Private Foundation, the organization managing the artist’s legacy that is represented by Gagosian, Galerie Eva Presenhuber, and Galerie Bärbel Grässlin.

                The drama over West’s art began not long after he died in 2012 and has involved two conflicting entities: the Franz West Private Foundation, which the artist formed during his final days, and the Franz West Archive, which was established during the late ’90s. After West’s death, the Franz West Archive began seeking control of his art, launching a number of lawsuits against the foundation, which is directed by his former studio manager</p>

              <h2>Previously Unseen Painting Technique Was Used by Rembrandt in ‘The Night Watch,’ New Study Reveals</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SK-C-5-copy.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
             <p>
              Rembrandt painted the surface of his canvas for his famous 1642 oil painting The Night Watch with a substance containing lead before applying the first ground layer of paint, according to new research published today in Science Advances.

              Though Rembrandt didn’t shy away from experimenting with new techniques, the use of a lead-based layer has never been seen before among works by Rembrandt or his contemporaries.
              
              This new discovery comes out of Operation Night Watch, a research and conservation project devoted to the history of the masterpiece. Researchers performed an advanced analysis using computational imaging on a paint sample taken from the work.

              <h2>The British Museum’s Decisive Year: A 2023 Filled with a Lot of Scandal, and Not Enough Change</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Year-in-Review-2023_british_museum.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
              <p>
                For many years, it was too easy to make jokes about how the British Museum is filled with stolen items. Comedian James Acaster is among the many who have teased the museum for that—his skits about the institution’s collection and its blanket refusal to return artifacts have even garnered 6.6 million views on YouTube.
                So it was a shock when the British Museum announced earlier this year that a staff member had been fired after the discovery of lost, stolen, and damaged items from its collection. The small Greco-Roman items had not been on public display, and many of them had not been catalogued or documented. Since then, news reports have revealed a stunning array of details about what caused such a scandal to take place at the venerated institution.</p>

                Giovanni Anselmo, one of the most important artists associated with the 1960s Italian art movement Arte Povera, has died at 89. His death was confirmed by Marian Goodman Gallery, his New York representative.

“A key protagonist of the Arte Povera movement and an artist of the Gallery for 39 years, Anselmo pursued and explored his practice in relation to nature, the finite and the indefinite, the visible and the invisible,” the gallery said in a statement.

Like many in the Arte Povera movement, Anselmo crafted oddball, highly memorable sculptures that combined industrial and organic matter. Many of Anselmo’s works subject materials—stones, steel, lettuce, fabric, glass, and more—to the forces of gravity.</p></a>

                <h2>More Than 1,000 Artists Boycott Bristol’s Arnolfini Center Amid Palestine Censorship Controversy</h2>
                <a href="#"><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-187446145.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
               <a href="#"><p>
                More than 1,000 artists across the cultural field—including Ben Rivers, Brian Eno, Adham Faramawy, and Tai Shani—have signed a new open letter that accuses Bristol’s Arnolfini International Centre for Contemporary Arts of “censorship of Palestinian culture,” after the institution canceled two events that were part of the city’s Palestine Film Festival. The signatories vow to no longer work with the Arnolfini or engage with its events and urge their peers in the field to join the boycott.

In November, the Arnolfini cancelled a screening of Farha (2021), a coming-of-age story set during the Nakba, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes during and after the 1948 Palestine war, by Jordanian-Palestinian director Darin J. Sallam. The screening was set to be followed by a Q&A with the Palestinian writer and doctor Ghada Karmi. The center was also scheduled to host a poetry reading headlined by the rapper and activist Lowkey. The screening of Farha will now be hosted at the arts charity Watershed, while the poetry event will take place at the department store and arts hub Sparks Bristol.</p></a>

            <h2>The Excavation of an ‘Unpromising’ Site in Central Italy Reveals the Strength of the Roman Empire</h2>
            <a href="#"><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-163295972.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
            <p>  The 13-year-long excavation of a what was once believed to be a “backwater town” in Central Italy has provided strong evidence that the Roman Empire remained powerful even as the fall of Rome, in 476, drew near.

              Since 2010 the Interamna Lirenas Project by the University of Cambridge’s Classics Faculty, has been conducting surveys and excavations in what, in modern times, looks like a field of crops, but in antiquity was the Roman town of Interamna Lirenas, according to Popular Mechanics.
              
              “We started with a site so unpromising that no one had ever tried to excavate it,” Alessandro Launaro, the study’s author and Interamna Lirenas Project lead at the University of Cambridge’s Classics Faculty, said in a statement. “That’s very rare in Italy.”</p>
