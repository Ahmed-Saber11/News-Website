              <h2> UK interest rates expected to fall sharply next year as inflation drops to 3.2</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0c214b826ae81868ba51c341f8a11850183574/13_54_2983_1790/master/2983.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
              <p>2
                The City is expecting interest rates to fall sharply next year following news of a much bigger than expected fall in the UK’s annual inflation rate to 3.9% in November
                Despite the Bank of England’s insistence it is too early to contemplate reducing the cost of borrowing, the markets believe Threadneedle Street will deliver at least four interest rate cuts during 202
                Share prices in London rallied strongly after cheaper fuel and less expensive food helped bring inflation from 4.6% in October to its lowest since September 2021. The FTSE 100 Index rose by around 1% to its highest level since May.
                With the economy weakening in response to 14 successive interest rate rises between December 2021 and August 2023, analysts predicted the Bank would start easing its policy stance next spring.
                Ed Monk, an associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Another significant drop in inflation in November only adds to the case that interest rates will fall sooner than expected. The Bank of England has been talking tough, but price rises appear on a rapid decline back towards the Bank’s target range and it may soon be that the risk for rate-setters is not under-tightening but over-tightening.”
                Swap rates in the City’s money markets were signalling five quarter-point cuts, which would take them from 5.25% to 4% by the end of next year, bringing welcome relief to households and businesses that have seen their borrowing costs soar.
                Kaulum Pickering, of Berenberg Bank, said: “Although Bank of England policymakers are at pains to push back against growing rate cut bets for 2024 while inflation is still well above target, the direction of travel for prices now seems clear. Although all key inflation measures remain above the 2% year on year rate which the Bank aims for, the trend of the past few months suggests that inflationary pressures are fading about as quickly as they had emerged.”
                The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the decline in the annual inflation rate was the result of prices falling by 0.2% in November compared with a rise of 0.4% in the same month a year ago. Cheaper fuel was the main reason for the dip in the headline rate below 4% in November, with the average price of petrol falling by four pence a litre month on month. 
                The ONS said food prices were also rising more slowly than a year ago, singling out bread and cakes, which fell in price compared with the previous month. However, overall food prices rose by 0.3% month on month and are still up annually – by 9.2%, compared with a 10.1% rate in October.</p>

              <h2>
                Energy price cap in Great Britain to fall by 14% in April, says forecaster</h2>
              <a href="#"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa5bdc196f94184fb84cd72186c0cd37f61a26b7/27_16_3842_2304/master/3842.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none" alt="" class="thumbnail" /></a>
             <p>
              The energy price cap in Great Britain is expected to fall by 14% in April because of cheaper oil and gas prices, according to an influential forecaster – although disruption to shipping in the Red Sea has added uncertainty to its prediction.

              The average annual electricity and gas bill should fall by about £268 to £1,660 in April, Cornwall Insight said. The independent research company copies the methods used by the industry’s regulator, Ofgem, in analysing energy markets to calculate its predictions for the cap.
              
              The anticipated fall in the price cap next spring is a further sign that Britain’s two-year cost of living crisis is easing, after official figures today showed the annual inflation rate dropped to 3.9% in November, from 4.6% in October.
              
              Energy markets have been roiled in the last two years by crises, starting with the coronavirus pandemic followed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
              
              Global wholesale energy prices had fallen significantly since the last price cap announcement in late November, when Ofgem raised the quarterly cap, which is due to kick in on 1 January, by 5% to £1,928.
              However, oil prices have rebounded somewhat in recent days, in part because of attacks on commercial vessels passing through the Suez canal, a vital shipping route that carried about 4% of global seaborne oil in 2020, according to the data company Kpler.

                Toshiba, the Japanese company synonymous with the country’s 20th-century dominance of electronics, has delisted from the Tokyo stock exchange after 74 years.

                The manufacturer, associated in the UK with its 1980s “Ello Tosh, gotta Toshiba” advertising campaign, was taken private on Wednesday in an £11bn deal by a consortium of investors led by the private equity investor Japan Industrial Partners (JIP)..</p>

                <h2>
                  Workers at Tory donor’s JCB factory test positive for drugs after sniffer dogs called in</h2>
                <a href="#"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bf2416e7992408cfcc4425ab8c5b535e1a40388/1503_6_3617_2169/master/3617.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
               <a href="#"><p>
                JCB, one of the UK’s biggest manufacturers, is investigating a spate of drug use among workers based at its headquarters and has sacked a “significant” number of staff, the Guardian can reveal.

                A message sent to UK employees last week by the digger-maker’s group human resources director, Max Jeffery, seen by the Guardian, said it had been conducting a “series of investigations into substance misuse” over the past two months. This had resulted in a “small but significant number of people leaving JCB”.
                
                The message, entitled “Substance Misuse and Workplace Safety”, said investigations continued.
                
                Sniffer dogs have been used by private security at turnstiles at its Staffordshire headquarters, on production lines and in offices at the site last week.
                
                JCB, via its lawyers Schillings, said 22 staff tested positive for drugs or alcohol or refused to take a drugs test after being detected by sniffer dogs deployed at its sites over the course of a week.
                
                Of the 22 workers, it said about 75% tested positive for cannabis via urine testing, and further laboratory tests were being carried out on the results.
                
                JCB said the staff did not hold senior management positions. It did not say whether other drugs, including class A drugs such as cocaine that sources claim have been used by workers, were found in any tests.
                
                It said a further 11 UK workers had been sacked or resigned between April and December after refusing to take part in routine drug and alcohol testing or testing positive.
                
                JCB claimed it had the “inverse” of a drugs problem, that no drugs had been found on its sites, and said it had a “zero-tolerance approach to drug use and alcohol abuse”.
                
                There have been concerns about staff taking drugs on site and investigations have resulted in workers being pulled off production lines, sources allege. JCB’s lawyers said thorough and ongoing investigations at the company had found no evidence of drugs being taken or stored on site.
                
                JCB’s lawyers said it was “technically accurate to say that our client has not pro-actively informed the police (because their thorough investigation has not found evidence of illegal drugs on any JCB site)”. They added that officers were “aware of the situation” after a local newspaper informed police about sniffer dogs at the site.</p></a>

                <h2>
                  AI cannot be named as patent ‘inventor’, UK supreme court rules</h2>
                <a href="#"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f65931a5069c55410c67f942abc9fda697811f3/14_224_2964_1779/master/2964.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
               <a href="#"><p>
                Artificial intelligence cannot be legally named as an inventor to secure patent rights, the UK supreme court has ruled.

                In a judgment on Wednesday, Britain’s highest court concluded that “an inventor must be a person” in order to apply for patents under the current law.
                
                The ruling comes after the technologist Dr Stephen Thaler took his long-running dispute with the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to the country’s top court over its rejection of his attempt to list an AI he created as the inventor for two patents.
                
                The US-based developer claims the AI machine named DABUS autonomously created a food or drink container and a light beacon and that he is entitled to rights over its inventions. However, the IPO concluded in December 2019 that the expert was unable to officially register DABUS as the inventor in patent applications because it was not a person.
                
                The decision was upheld by the high court and the court of appeal in July 2020 and July 2021. After a hearing in March, a panel of five supreme court justices have unanimously dismissed Thaler’s case.
                
                The DABUS dispute centred on how applications are made under the Patents Act 1977 legislation, and the judges were not asked to rule on whether the AI actually created its inventions.
                
                Lord Kitchin, with whom Lords Hodge, Hamblen, Leggatt and Richards agreed, said the IPO “was right to decide that DABUS is not and was not an inventor of any new product or process described in the patent applications”.
                
                He continued: “It is not a person, let alone a natural person and it did not devise any relevant invention. Accordingly, it is not and never was an inventor for the purposes of … the 1977 act.        
                The judge said the IPO was entitled to find that Thaler’s applications should be taken as “withdrawn” under patent rules because “he failed to identify any person or persons whom he believed to be the inventor or inventors of the inventions described in the applications”.     
                The supreme court also rejected Thaler’s argument that he was entitled to apply for patents for DABUS inventions on the basis that he was the AI’s owner.    
                Kitchin said DABUS was “a machine with no legal personality” and that Dr Thaler “has no independent right to obtain a patent in respect of any such technical advance”.</p></a>

                <h2>Fears of higher oil prices after Red Sea attacks</h2>
                <a href="#"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/46A8/production/_132088081_boat.png.webp" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>

                Attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea risk pushing up the price of oil and other goods, analysts have warned.

Several firms have paused shipments through the route after vessels were attacked by Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The world's second largest shipping line, Maersk, said on Tuesday that it would reroute some of its vessels around Africa's Cape of Good Hope.

The disruption has led the US to launch an international naval operation to protect ships on the Red Sea route.

Countries joining the security action - named Operation Prosperity Guardian - include the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain.

The US has also said it would welcome China playing a constructive role in trying to prevent further attacks.

The analysts' warnings came as the rebels vowed to continue their attacks in the Bab al-Mandeb strait, a vital shipping lane between Asia and Europe.

"Even if America succeeds in mobilising the entire world, our military operations will not stop... no matter the sacrifices it costs us," said senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti on X, formerly Twitter.

                Apple will stop selling its latest watches in the US, after the US found it had violated patent rights.

An order barring sales and imports of watches with the disputed blood oxygen feature is due to go into effect on 26 December.

Apple has said it plans to appeal the decision but would "pre-emptively" remove the devices from its US site 21 December and from stores in the country after Christmas Eve.

Sales elsewhere are not affected.

"Apple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers," Apple said.

The issue stems from a dispute with California-based medical device firms Masimo and spin-off Cercacor, which have accused the iPhone giant of poaching key staff and taking other steps to steal technology it developed to measure oxygen levels in the blood.</p></a>

            <h2>
              ‘I was cut off four times’: Virgin Media customers say it’s too hard to cancel costly contracts</h2>
            <a href="#"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fe195cd3bef7e5497b7dd0be02a2974be1a55f2/0_116_3882_2329/master/3882.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none" alt="" class="thumbnail" /> </a>
            <p>In the last January transfer window, 33 players left Major League Soccer for Europe. Top European clubs are increasingly looking to US soccer in search of stars who, thanks to the American season finishing in December, are primed to hit the ground running upon arrival.

              Broadband customers claim they are trapped in costly contracts with Virgin Media five months after the telecoms regulator launched an investigation into the company’s cancellation procedures.

              Ofcom announced its inquiry in July after complaints that Virgin was placing “unnecessary barriers” in the way of customers who wanted to switch to cheaper providers after their fixed-term contracts had expired.
              
              Many have faced tariff increases of more than 50% due to the end of fixed-term deals and the company’s record-breaking price rises.
              
              Five months on, Ofcom has no updates on its investigation. In the meantime, more customers report being left out of pocket because of an inability to cancel.
              
              Joe Stafford spent a month trying to end his broadband contract when the monthly tariff soared by 52% after his minimum term expired.
              
              “I initially tried to use their web chat service, but after leaving it open all day for two consecutive days, I gave up,” he said. “I then spent hours on hold to their helpline which is permanently ‘exceptionally busy’, and was cut off four times when I got to speak to somebody.”
              
              When his cancellation request was finally accepted, he was erroneously charged a £49 early termination fee. He said his call to customer services was cut off again after a two-hour wait when he was connected to an adviser. Virgin refunded the fee and a month’s service charges after intervention from the Guardian.
              
              Unlike providers who use the rival Openreach cable network, Virgin Media does not allow its six million broadband customers to cancel expired contracts online. Thirty days’ notice is required before any switch, compared with the 14 days’ notice required to switch Openreach providers.
              
              Complainants say that calls are left unanswered or cut out and that advisers tried to hard-sell them new packages.
              
              It took Hagen Schumacher 40 days instead of the contractual 30 to cancel his £77.50 a month contract after the minimum term. He was then threatened with debt collectors unless he paid charges accrued during the 10-day delay.
              
              “The call centre agent first tried to sell me another package. When I declined I was put on hold and after an hour’s wait the call disconnected,” he said. “I tried their Live Chat which is manned by a chatbot and got cut off after waiting 83 minutes for an agent. I then sent a registered letter to cancel.” Virgin Media admitted a delay and refunded the extra fee after contact from the Guardian.
